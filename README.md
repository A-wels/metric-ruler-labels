# Roger's Additional Metric Ruler Labels

For everyone that uses the metric system in the real world and wants to know the metric distances without changing the DnD system.

GM:
> A 20 feet wide gorge lies ahead of your party. What do you do?

*You are asking yourself:* 
> 20 feet ... is this wide? Should i try jumping across it?

<br>
This module will help you to better understand distances. <br>
It adds additional labels for the metric measurements to your ruler. It is not changing any systems etc. It only applies an additional label to the UI.

### The following units are supported:

- ft, ft. and feet will get converted to meters (5 ft -> 1,5 m)
- mi, mi., and miles will be converted to kilometers (1 mile -> 1,61 km)

## Example feet to meters

## Example miles to kilometers

I only tested it with FoundryVTT 0.8.9 but it should work with other versions that the two dependencies support (0.8.5 and later).

Also thanks to those developers :)
